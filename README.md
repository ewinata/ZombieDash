# Description

This is a school project that involves implementing the model and some of the controllers for a graphic mini-game
The design and structure of code was provided, I was simply tasked with connecting the skeleton code and implementing them.
Basically, the main function instantiates a controller to maintain game states, freeglut is used to run and maintain the infinite loop
for the game. Models are instantiated and accessed as needed depending on the controller state.
